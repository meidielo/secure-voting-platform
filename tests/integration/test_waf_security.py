"""
WAF Security Tests for Voting System

These tests specifically target WAF (Web Application Firewall) security features:
- SQL injection blocking via ModSecurity OWASP CRS
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) prevention via ModSecurity
- Rate limiting via nginx limit_req
- Security headers validation
- Template processing validation

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (based on test results):
✅ ModSecurity OWASP CRS: ACTIVE - Blocking SQL injection and XSS attacks (403 responses)
✅ Security Headers: ACTIVE - X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, etc.
✅ Rate Limiting: ACTIVE - nginx limit_req working correctly with conditional limits:
  - Strict mode: restrictive limits for production security
  - Test mode: relaxed limits for development/integration testing
✅ Endpoint-specific Security: ACTIVE - Different security levels for /, /vote, /dev/

Run with: pytest tests/integration/test_waf_security.py -v -s --log-cli-level=ERROR
Run against Docker: pytest tests/integration/test_waf_security.py -v -s --log-cli-level=ERROR --base-url=http://localhost

The -s flag shows print output, and --log-cli-level=ERROR shows detailed vulnerability
reports including the actual response content when security issues are detected.
This allows you to verify exactly what the server returned and confirm the detection logic.
