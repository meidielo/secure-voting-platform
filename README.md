# SecureVote — Secure Electronic Voting Platform

A production-grade secure online voting platform built with Flask, featuring enterprise-level security controls including PII encryption at rest, multi-factor authentication, Web Application Firewall integration, and cryptographic result signing via HashiCorp Vault.

Built as part of a Secure Software Systems course — originally a team project, completed and enhanced as a solo portfolio piece.

## Key Security Features

- **PII Encryption at Rest** — Voter personal data encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD)
- **Web Application Firewall** — OWASP ModSecurity CRS via nginx reverse proxy
- **Cryptographic Result Signing** — Election results signed via HashiCorp Vault Transit engine (non-repudiation)
- **HMAC-Backed Audit Logging** — Tamper-evident audit trail with chain verification
- **Role-Based Access Control** — Voter, Delegate, Manager roles with enforced permissions
- **Account Security** — Lockout after 5 failed attempts, 90-day password expiry, 12-char minimum with complexity requirements
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** — Email-based OTP with 5-minute expiry
- **Geo-IP Filtering** — Country-level access restriction via MaxMind GeoIP2
- **Rate Limiting** — Per-endpoint limits (voting: 2 req/min, general: 500 req/min)
- **Election State Management** — Draft/open/close lifecycle with time-based enforcement

**Split Database Connections:** Admin and voter operations route to separate MySQL users with different permission sets, enforced at the ORM session level.

## Quick Start

### Local Development (SQLite)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_demo.py
# Access: http://localhost:5000
```

### Docker (Full Stack)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
# Web (WAF-protected): http://localhost
# Vault UI: http://localhost:8200 (token: vault-dev-token)
```

### Default Test Credentials

| Role | Username | Password |
|------|----------|----------|
| Manager | admin | Admin@123456! |
| Delegate | delegate1 | Delegate@123! |
| Voter | voter1 | Password@123! |

## Features

### Voter Flow
1. Register with driver licence validation (checksum-verified)
2. Email verification link sent automatically
3. Admin reviews and approves account
4. Log in (with optional MFA)
5. Cast vote for candidates in your region (one vote enforced by DB constraint)
6. View confirmation

### Manager Flow
- Approve/reject user registrations (with email verification status visible)
- Unlock locked accounts
- Create and manage elections (draft/open/close lifecycle)
- View vote tallies and sign results cryptographically
- Verify signed results for non-repudiation

### Delegate Flow
- Manage candidates within assigned region (region guards enforced)
- View regional electoral roll data

### Security Controls
- Password reset via signed, time-limited email tokens (30-min expiry)
- Generic responses to prevent email enumeration
- CSRF protection via nonce validation
- GOTCHA honeypot fields for bot detection
- Cloudflare Turnstile integration (optional)
- Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, HSTS headers via nginx

## Testing

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest tests/test_smoke.py -v          # Unit tests
python tests/test_waf_demo.py                    # WAF effectiveness
python tests/test_vote_rate_limiting.py           # Rate limiting
```

The CI/CD pipeline runs on every push via GitHub Actions, including security-specific tests on a nightly schedule.
